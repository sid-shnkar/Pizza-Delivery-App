# Pizza-Delivery-App
A full stack web development project built using **ReactJS**, **NestJS**, **MongoDB** and **Express**. It simulates a food delivery app for a pizza delivery company.

## Steps to run the program:
To start running up the project, open the terminal and type the following command then hit enter:
```
 npm install
```

**Note:** For email sending services, I have used **Mailgun**, refer to [here](https://www.mailgun.com/). You need to create a free acoount inorder to get your API key
and SMTP credentials, that are required by this feature to be working. Replace the key values in ```backend/src/pizza``` with your own credentials.
